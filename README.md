# FCGU - Repo for GNOME pre-releases
"FCGU" was a Git repo for PKGBUILDs as well as a binary repo of GNOME pre-releases for [**Arch Linux**](https://archlinux.org).

Because the [project lead](https://archlinux.org/people/trusted-users/#fabiscafe) is now part of the Arch Linux crew, FCGU was dropped in favor of Arch' [gnome-unstable](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Official_repositories#gnome-unstable) Repo.

## How to change back to Arch' default GNOME?
The repo needs to be removed from */etc/pacman.conf*

```
[fcgu]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/fcgu-mirrorlist
```

When that's done a `pacman -Syuu` will downgrade all packages to the Arch-repo versions. After thats done, you need to check for additional packages who where not removed but can conflict with your installation. Check with `pacman -Qm` and remove them.
