# FCGU - Repo for GNOME pre-releases
Welcome stranger!
If you look for GNOME pre-releases for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), check out the official [**gnome-unstable**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Official_repositories#gnome-unstable) repo!

In the past, "FCGU" was a Git repo for PKGBUILDs as well as a binary repo of GNOME pre-releases for, but in 2023 I joined the Arch Linux team and provide packages directly over there.
